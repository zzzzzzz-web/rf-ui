# RF UI Challenge

This is a Vite app with Svelte, TypeScript, and SCSS

You can install the node packages and run the dev server or production preview.

I have also included a single file html page that can just be loaded into a browser called single.html.

## Installation
```
    npm install
```

## Run Dev Server
```
    npm run dev
```

## Build for Production
```
    npm run build
```
Note: Build files are already included in the zip in /dist directory.

## Preview Production
```
    npm run preview
```
